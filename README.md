## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Talita, and I'm a Mathematics student.

ðŸ“š I'm passionate about combining Mathematics and Programming, exploring ways to apply mathematical concepts to solve computational problems and create educational projects.

ðŸ’» I have experience with Python and I'm currently learning PHP. I'm also very interested in computational thinking in education, looking for strategies to make learning more engaging and meaningful through technology.

ðŸš€ I enjoy working with logic, algorithms, and mathematical visualization. I'm always eager to learn new things, build projects, and share knowledge.
